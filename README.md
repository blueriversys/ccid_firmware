## CCID smartcard firmware

This is a CCID firmware for the ATMEL AT91SAM7S256 chip.
<br>
Once installed on the dongle (we call it card), the host OS will identify it as a smartcard reader with a card permantly inserted in it.

## How to build
You'll need:
<br>
WinARM: https://www.ledato.de/download/WinARM-20060606-Compiler.exe
<br>
Mingw Tools: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/

## How to use it
This device is great to store small files you want to be private, such as private key files, passwords, etc.
<br>
It requires a client software for Windows, whose link will be provided shortly here.
